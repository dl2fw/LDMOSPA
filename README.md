# LDMOSPA
LDMOS PA based on the design of DJ0ABR - case from PCB Material<br>
Output poer 750 or 1500 Watt - depends on if you use 1 or 2 double mosfets<br>
The PA can be either water or air cooled - the case makes both possible - I prefer the water cooled version<br>
The case fits to DB5AT's Wolf SDR case based on PCB Material<br>
All gerbers are available here<br>
I tried to gather all schematics and gerbers for the PA<br>
Also BOMS for Digikey, Reichelt and Aliexpress are in the BOM folder<br>
The water cooler is a ready available one (Digikey,...) for app. 65â‚¬<br>
